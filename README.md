## About This Project

I initially created this tool for personal use while playing a fishing game. However, I've decided to share it with the community to receive feedback and enhance its features in future updates. Please note, this tool is strictly for educational purposes and is not intended to promote gambling or any related activities.

## Features

- **CSV File Handling**: Easily upload CSV files and analyze the data.
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify patterns of different lengths within your data.
- **Customizable Settings**: Choose columns, define pattern lengths, and set sorting preferences.
- **Automatic Reload**: Automatically reload data at regular intervals to keep your analysis up-to-date.
- **Modern User Interface**: Designed with a responsive, modern interface using `ttkbootstrap`.

## Why Use This Tool?

Creating a pattern recognizer is not overly complex; however, I have accumulated a dataset of over 10,000 real historical values specifically for this tool. The dataset is updated regularly to ensure its relevance and accuracy.

### Note on Data Collection

I cannot share the data-gathering tool publicly due to ethical reasons, but rest assured that all data is collected responsibly and is intended purely for educational use.
